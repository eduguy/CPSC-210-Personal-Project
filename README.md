# CPSC 210 Personal Project: Interactive Map of the Hive

## Project Proposal

The goal of this application is to provide an interactive
map of the *Hive Climbing and Fitness* (Surrey) that can be 
be used to display all boulders in the gym, and can be updated as 
new boulders are set. Additionally, it will be able to allow the user
to sort by difficulty and style of the problem. Users of this application
could be other climbers as well as other gyms who may choose to 
modify this program for their own floor plan.

This project is of interest to me because I am an avid rock climber
and I spend most of my free time there. However, when I went to
the gym for the first time, and whenever I go to a different gym, I find the
selection of climbs daunting. I think an application that could sort climbs 
and provide a map of where they are in the gym would be useful to newcomers.
