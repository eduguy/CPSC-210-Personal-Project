# CPSC 210 Personal Project: Climb Tracker for the Climbing Gym

## Project Proposal

The goal of this application is to provide an interface for a user to track climbs
in the rock climbing gym and add/remove climbs as they are set or removed.
 Eventually, this functionality will be extended into an interactive
map of the rock climbing gym that can be 
be used to display all boulders in the gym. Additionally, it will be able to allow the user
to sort by difficulty and location of the boulders. Users of this application
could be other climbers.

This project is of interest to me because I am an avid rock climber
and I spend most of my free time there. However, when I went to
the gym for the first time, and whenever I go to a different gym, I find the
amount of climbs and lack of organization annoying. There is never any documentation on the climbs that
 is all in once place.
 I think an application that could sort climbs 
and provide a map of where they are in the gym would be useful to newcomers.
